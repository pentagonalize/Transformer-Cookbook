  abstract = {A new hypothesis for the organization of synapses between
              neurons is proposed: ``The synapse from neuron x to neuron y is
              reinforced when x fires provided that no neuron in the vicinity
              of y is firing stronger than y''. By introducing this hypothesis,
              a new algorithm with which a multilayered neural network is
              effectively organized can be deduced. A self-organizing
              multilayered neural network, which is named ``cognitron'', is
              constructed following this algorithm, and is simulated on a
              digital computer. Unlike the organization of a usual brain models
              such as a three-layered perceptron, the self-organization of a
              cognitron progresses favorably without having a ``teacher'' which
              instructs in all particulars how the individual cells respond.
              After repetitive presentations of several stimulus patterns, the
              cognitron is self-organized in such a way that the receptive
              fields of the cells become relatively larger in a deeper layer.
              Each cell in the final layer integrates the information from
              whole parts of the first layer and selectively responds to a
              specific stimulus pattern or a feature.},

  abstract  = {Feed-forward layers constitute two-thirds of a transformer model{'}s parameters, yet their role in the network remains under-explored. We show that feed-forward layers in transformer-based language models operate as key-value memories, where each key correlates with textual patterns in the training examples, and each value induces a distribution over the output vocabulary. Our experiments show that the learned patterns are human-interpretable, and that lower layers tend to capture shallow patterns, while upper layers learn more semantic ones. The values complement the keys{'} input patterns by inducing output distributions that concentrate probability mass on tokens likely to appear immediately after each pattern, particularly in the upper layers. Finally, we demonstrate that the output of a feed-forward layer is a composition of its memories, which is subsequently refined throughout the model{'}s layers via residual connections to produce the final output distribution.}

However, theoretical understanding remains limited, with existing expressiveness theory either overpredicting or underpredicting realistic learning abilities. We prove that, under the transformer architecture, the loss landscape is constrained by the input-space sensitivity: Transformers whose output is sensitive to many parts of the input string inhabit isolated points in parameter space, leading to a low-sensitivity bias in generalization. We show theoretically and empirically that this theory unifies a broad array of empirical observations about the learning abilities and biases of transformers, such as their generalization bias towards low sensitivity and low degree, and difficulty in length generalization for PARITY. This shows that understanding transformers{'} inductive biases requires studying not just their in-principle expressivity, but also their loss landscape.}

This suggested that natural language can be approximated well with models that are too weak for formal languages, or that the role of hierarchy and recursion in natural language might be limited. We qualify this implication by proving that self-attention networks can process Dyck-(k, D), the subset of Dyck-k with depth bounded by D, which arguably better captures the bounded hierarchical structure of natural language. Specifically, we construct a hard-attention network with D+1 layers and O(log k) memory size (per token per layer) that recognizes Dyck-(k, D), and a soft-attention network with two layers and O(log k) memory size that generates Dyck-(k, D). Experiments show that self-attention networks trained on Dyck-(k, D) generalize to longer inputs with near-perfect accuracy, and also verify the theoretical memory advantage of self-attention networks over recurrent networks.",
