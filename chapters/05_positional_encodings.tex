Many different kinds of ingredients here.

\section{Finite Image}

\section{Powers of $i$}

One recurring theme is using four consecutive powers of $i$, for example, $1/i^2, 1/i, 1, i$. It's not always the same powers of $i$. No idea why four are needed.

\section{Trees}

It is possible to, using positional encoding, represent positions as nodes of directed trees with ordered lists of children.
This is done using a left-appended sliding window of one-hot-encoding vectors of the transitions taken from the root node's positional encoding \citep{shiv2019}.

\section{Length-Dependent}

\subsection{$\frac{i}{n}$}
